// Package crypto contains all the cryptographic primitives used in Indra.
//
// There is the standard public/private keys, signature and validation functions, cloaked public keys used in message and packets.
//
// A set of implementations of these primitives based on the above are present for implementing interfaces to use them with libp2p.
//
// A set of helper functions for frequently used operations involving multiple items or derivations are here also.
